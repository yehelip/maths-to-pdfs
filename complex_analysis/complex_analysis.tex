\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Complex numbers}

\begin{definition}[Complex number]
    A complex number is an expression of the form $x + yi$ such that
    $x,y \in \R$ and $i$ is a `imaginary number' not in $\R$.
    We denote
    \[
        \Re(z) := x \tand \Im(z) := y.
    \]
    If $\Im(z) = 0$ then $z$ is said to be a real number, and if
    $\Re(z) = 0$ then it is said to be purely imaginary.
\end{definition}

The set of all complex numbers is denoted as $\C$ and it can be made into
a field with the following operations.
\[
    z_1 + z_2 = (x_1 + x_2) + (y_1 + y_2) i \tand
    z_1 z_2 = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2) + (x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2) i.
\]

Note that $i^2 = -1$.
Also note that $T(x + y i) = (x, y)$ is a bijection between $\C$ and $\R$ and
moreover, we have that $T$ is additive.
That is
\[
    T(z_1 + z_2) = T(z_1) + T(z_2)
\]
which gives complex addition a geometric meaning.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [->] (-0.5, 0) -- (3, 0) node [right] {Re};
    \draw [->] (0, -0.5) -- (0, 2) node [above] {Im};
    \draw [->] (0, 0) -- (.5, 1) node [above] {$z_1$};
    \draw [->] (0, 0) -- (2, .7) node [above] {$z_2$};
    \draw [->] (0, 0) -- (2.5, 1.7) node [anchor=south west] {$z_1 + z_2$};
    \draw [dashed] (.5, 1) -- (2.5, 1.7) -- (2, .7);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The absolute value of a complex number $x + y i = z \in \C$ is defined by
\[
    |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
Note that $|z| = \norm{(x,y)}= \norm{T(z)}$ where $\norm{\cdot}$ is the standard
Euclidean norm on $\R^2$.

This implies that $|z - w|$ should be considered the distance between natural
numbers $z$, $w$.
Because we have that $|z| = \norm{T(z)}$ we also have that the triangle
inequality holds:
\[
    |z + w| \le |z| + |w| \text{ for all } z,w \in \C.
\]

\begin{definition}[Complex conjugate]
    The complex conjugate of $x + y i = z \in C$ is the complex number
    $x - y i$. The complex conjugate of $z$ is denoted $\bar{z}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [->] (-0.5, 0) -- (3, 0) node [right] {Re};
    \draw [->] (0, -1) -- (0, 2) node [above] {Im};
    \draw [->] (0, 0) -- (2, .7) node [above] {$z_2$};
    \draw [->] (0, 0) -- (2, -.7) node [above] {$\bar z_2$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

It is easy to verify that
\[
    \Re(z) = \frac{z + \bar{z}}{2} \tand 
    \Re(z) = \frac{z - \bar{z}}{2 i} \tand
    |z|^2 = z \bar{z}.
\]

Given $\theta$ we can denote $e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$,
and then describe any complex number $z \in \C$ as $r e^{i \theta}$
for some $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$ and $r > 0$.
We get that $|z| = |r e^{i \theta}| = r$.
We also have that $\theta$ describes the angle of $z$ with the $x$-axis
and it is usually denoted $\theta = \arg(z)$.

\subsection{Convergence}

\begin{definition}[Convergence]
    We say that the sequence $\set{z_n}_{n \geq 1} \subset \C$ converges
    to some $z_0 \in \C$ if $|z - z_0| \taking{n \to \infty} 0$.
    In this case, we call $z_0$ the limit of the sequence of
    $\set{z_n}_{n \geq 1}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    It is easy to verify that the limit is unique, and that
    $z_n \taking{n \to \infty} z$ if and only if
    $T(z_n) \taking{n \to \infty} T(z)$ in the Euclidean metric.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Cauchy sequence]
    A sequence $\set{z_n}_{n \geq 1}$ is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for
    all $\espilon > 0$ there exists $N > 1$ such that for all $n,m > N$
    we have that $|z_n - z_m| < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The complex plane $\C$ is complete.
    That is, every Cauchy sequence converges in $\C$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The proof follows immediately from the known fact that $\R$ is complete
    and the previous remark.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Sets in the complex plane}

\begin{definition}[Open disc]
    For $z_0 \in \C$ and $r > 0$ we set
    \[
        D_r(z_0) := \set{z \in \C \colon |z - z_0| < r}.
    \]
    We call $D_r(z_0)$ the open disc at center $z_0$ with radius $r$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Closed disc]
    For $z_0 \in \C$ and $r > 0$ we set
    \[
        \overline D_r(z_0) := \set{z \in \C \colon |z - z_0| \le r}.
    \]
    We call $\overline D_r(z_0)$ the closed disc at center $z_0$ with
    radius $r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Circle]
    For $z_0 \in \C$ and $r > 0$ we set
    \[
        C_r(z_0) := \set{z \in \C \colon |z - z_0| = r}.
    \]
    We call $C_r(z_0)$ the circle at center $z_0$ with radius $r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Interior point]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that $z \in \Omega$ is an interior
    point of $\Omega$ if exists $r > 0$ such that $D_r(z) \subset \Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Interior of a set]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that the interior of $\Omega$ is
    the collection of all interior points of $\Omega$.
    We denote the interior as $\Int(\Omega)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open set]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that $\Omega$ is an open set if
    $\Int(\Omega) = \Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed set]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that $\Omega$ a closed set if
    $\Omega^c := \C \setminus \Omega$ is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Limit point]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that $z \in \Omega$ is an interior
    point of $\Omega$ if there exists a sequence $z_n$ such that
    $z_n \neq z$ for all $n > 1$ and $z_n \taking{n \to \infty} z$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $\Omega \subset \C$ be given.
    Then $\Omega$ is closed if and only if it contains
    all of its limit points.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Clear.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Closure]
    Let $\Omega \subset \C$ be given.
    The closure of $\Omega$, denoted $\overline \Omega$, is defined
    as
    \[
        \overline \Omega =
        \Omega \cup
        \set{z \in \C \mid \text{$x$ is a limit point of $\Omega$}}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that $\Omega$ is closed if and only if $\overline \Omega = \Omega$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Boundary]
    The boundary of $\Omega \subset \C$ is denoted by $\partial \Omega$
    and defined by $\partial \Omega := \Omega \setminus \Int(\Omega)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Diameter]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we define the diameter of $\Omega$ as
    \[
        \diam(\Omega) := \sup\set{|z - w| \colon z,w \in \Omega}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bounded set]
    Given $\Omega \subset \C$, we say that $\Omega$ is bounded if
    $\diam(\Omega) < \infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    It is clear that a set $\Omega \susbet \C$ is bounded if and only if
    there exists $z_0 \in \C$ and $r > 0$ such that $\Omega \susbet D_r(z_0)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Compact set]
    A subset $\Omega$ of $\C$ is said to be compact if it is closed and 
    bounded.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\tt{Bolzano--Weierstrass theorem}
    A subset $\Omega$ in $\C$ is compact if and only if every seqeuence
    $\set{z_n}_{n \geq 1}$ has a subsequence $\set{z_{n_k}}$ such that
    $z_{n_k} \taking{k \to \infty} z$ for some $z \in \C$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\tt{Cantor's intersection lemma}
    Let $\Omega_1, \Omega_2, \dots$ be nonempty compact subsets of $\C$.
    Suppose that $\Omega_{n+1} \subset \Omega_n$ for all $n \geq 1$,
    and that $\diam(\Omega_n) \taking{n \to \infty} 0$.
    Then $\cap_{n \geq 1} \Omega_n = \set{z}$ for some $z \in \C$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Choose $z_n \in \Omega_n$ for all $n \geq 1$.
    Because $\diam \Omega \taking{n \to \infty} = 0$ we have that
    $\set{z_n}_{n \geq 1}$ is a Cauchy sequence and therefore it converges
    to some $z \in \C$. Because $\Omega_n$ is compact for every $n \geq 1$
    we get that $z \in \cap_{n \geq 1} \Omega_n$.
    This means that $\cap_{n \geq 1} \Omega_n \neq \emptyset$.

    Let $z,w \in \Omega$.
    Because $\diam \Omega \taking{n \to \infty} 0$ we have that
    $|z - w| \le 0$ and thus $z = w$ which implies that
    $\cap_{n \geq 1} \Omega_n = \set{z}$ which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Connected open set]
    A nonempty open set $\Omega \subset \C$ is said to be connected if it does
    not contain disjoint nonempty open subsets $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ such
    that $\Omega = \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2$. A connected open set in 
    $\C$ will be called a region.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Connected closed set]
    A nonempty open set $\Omega \subset \C$ is said to be connected if it does
    not contain disjoint nonempty closed subsets $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ such
    that $\Omega = \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    It can be shown that $\Omega$ is connected if and only if for any
    $z, w \in \Omega$ there exists a curve $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to \Omega$
    such that $\gamma(0) = z$ and $\gamma(1)$.
    This implies that open and closed discs, as well as circles, are
    connected.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Continuous functions}

\begin{definition}[Continuous function]
    Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty subset of $\C$ and let 
    $f \colon \Omega \to \C$ be given.
    We say that $f$ is continuous at a point $z_0 \in \Omega$ 
    if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ so
    that $|f(z) - f(z_0)| < \epsilon$ for all $z \in \Omega$ with 
    $|z - z_0| < \delta$.
    We say that $f$ is continuous on $\Omega$ if it is continuous at every 
    $z_0 \in \Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    It is easy to verify that the functions $\Im$, $\Re$, $|\cdot|$, and
    $\theta \mapsto e^{i \theta}$ are all continuous.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
    The composition of continuous functions is continuous.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Bounded function]
    Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty subset of $\C$ and let 
    $f \colon \Omega \to \C$ be given.
    We say that $f$ is bounded if there exists $M > 0$ so that 
    $|f(z)| < M$ for all $z \in \Omega$.
    We say that $f$ attains a maximum if there exists $z_M \in \Omega$
    such that $f(z) \le f(z_M)$ for all $z \in \Omega$.
    We define when $f$ attains a minimum similarly.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty compact subset of $\C$, and let 
    $f \colon \Omega \to \C$ be continuous.
    Then $f$ is bounded, and it attains its maximum and minimum on $\Omega$.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Holomorphic functions}

\begin{definition}[Holomorphic function]
    Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty open subset of $\C$ and let 
    $f \colon \Omega \to \C$ be given.
    We say that $f$ is holomorphic at a point $z \in \Omega$
    if the following limit exists
    \[
        f'(z) := \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z + h) - f(z)}{h}.
    \]
    The number $f'(z)$ is called the derivative of $f$ at $z$.
\end{definition}
