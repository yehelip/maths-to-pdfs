\begin{exercise}
  Prove that a continuous function $f\colon A\to B$ has 
  a maximum in a compact space
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  By the completeness axiom for the real numbers we know that the set
  $f(A)$ has a supremum which we will denote $S$. By the definition
  of the supremum it is possible to construct a sequence that converges
  to it which we shall denote $f(x^n)$. We don't know whether $x^n$
  converges or not but we know it has a subsequence that converges so:
  \[
    \lim_{k\to\infty}{x^{n_k}} = x \quad \text{and} \quad 
    \lim_{k\to\infty}{f(x^{n_k})} = S
  \]
  Since $f$ is close we get $x\in A$ and since it is continuous $f(x) = S$
  which shows that it is continuous and also has a maximum.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that a set $E$ is closed if and only if it's complement
  $E^c$ is open
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  First suppose that $E$ is closed, and $E^c$ is not open. Then exists
  $x\notin E$ such that for all $r > 0$ we get $B_r(x) \cap E \neq 
  \emptyset$ which means we can construct a sequence in $E$ that converges
  to $x$ but $x\notin E$ in contradiction to the assumption that $E$ is 
  close.

  Suppose next that $E^c$ is open and $E$ is not closed, then exists a sequence
  $(x^n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ that converges to some $x \in E^c$ which means
  that for every $r > 0$ that $B_r(x) \cap E \neq \emptyset$ in 
  contradiction to $E^c$ being open.
\end{solution}
