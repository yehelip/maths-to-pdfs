\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
The Riemann integral we have known so far is fairly limited.
For example it doesn't allow us to compute the Riemann integral
of Dirichlet's function $f \colon [0,1] \to \R$ defined as
\[
  f(x) = \mathbbm{1}_{\Q \cap [0,1]} =
  \begin{cases}
    1, &x \in \Q \cap [0,1] \\
    0, &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}.
\]
In his thesis Lebesgue introduced a new type of integral called
a Lebesgue integral that allows us to compute integrals for functions
like Dirichelt's function, and he continued to develop more concepts
like measure, and almost everywhere.

\subsection{Lebesgue integral}
Let $f(x) = \mathbbm{1}_A$ be the function that 
we want $\int \mathbbm{1}_A$ to be the volume of the set $A$.

First we would like we define what is a volume of a set.
We would want to require a couple of things
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)] $\mu(A)$ is defined for all $A \subseteq \R^n$;
  \item[(2)] $\mu([0,1]^n) = 1^n = 1$;
  \item[(3)] $\mu$ to be invariant to congruations (isometries).
  \item[(4)] If $\set{A_i}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ is a countable sequence
    of pairwise disjoint sets then
    \[
      \mu\del{\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)}.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
  Property $(4)$ is called $\sigma$-additivity.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Hausdorrf, 1914]
  There is no function that satisfies $(1) - (4)$ at the same time.
\end{theorem}

We will prove this theorem later.
For now we can only try to weaken the requirements.
For example instead of $\sigma$-additivity we might require finite
additivity.

\begin{theorem}
  There exists a function that satisfies the wanted requirements in
  dimenstions $1$ and $2$ but not in dimension $n \geq 3$.
\end{theorem}

For example in $n = 3$ we have the Banach-Tarski paradox

\begin{paradox}[Banach--Tarski, 1924]
  For every $n \geq 1$ we can divide $S^2$ in $\R^n$ to a finite amount 
  of parts such that when they are rotated and rearranged,
  can form a new sphere of any desired size.
\end{paradox}
\begin{remark}
  The bigger sphere we would want to form, the greater is the minimal
  pieces we need to divide the unit sphere in order to form it.
\end{remark}

This paradox is based on the use of the axiom of choice, but since we
assume the axiom of choice in this course we still need to modify the
requirements.

Instead of $(4)$ we require subadditivity:
\[
  \mu\del{\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \le \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)}.
\]
This is possible but instead we would like to keep $\sigma$-additivity
but instead give up on requirement $(0)$.
We will only define volume only for ``nice'' sets which include
all of the sets we work with in analysis or geometry etc.\ these
sets form a $\sigma$-algebra on $\R^n$.

\begin{definition}[Algebra]
  An algebra on a nonempty set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal A$ of
  subsets of $X$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal A$;
    \item[(2)] $\mathcal A$ is closed under complement;
    \item[(3)] $\mathcal A$ is closed under finite unions and intersections.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$\sigma$-algebra]
  A $\sigma$-algebra on a nonemptyset $X$ is an algebra $\mathcal A$ on
  $X$ that is also closed under countable unions and intersections.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  A $\sigma$-algebra is sometimes called a $\sigma$-field.
  That is why it is sometimes denoted $\mathcal F$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  From De-Morgan laws we know that
  \[
    \del{\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i}^c =
    \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i^c
  \]
  so it is only necessary to require closure under countable unions
  or countable intersections.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  It is also possible to require $\mathcal A$ to be nonempty.
  Then for $A \in \mathcal A$ we have
  \[
    A \in \mathcal \implies A^c \in \mathcal A \implies
    A \cup A^c = X \in \mathcal A \stand
    A \cap A^c = \emptyset \in \mathcal A.
  \]
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  $\mathcal A = 2^X$ and $\mathcal = \set{\emptyset, X}$ are the smallest
  and biggest $\sigma$-algebras.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  If $X$ is not countable.
  Then
  \[
    \mathcal A =
    \set{E \subseteq X \colon E \stor E^c \text{ are countable}} \neq
    2^X
  \]
  is a $\sigma$-algebra.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Cocountablility]
  Let $X$ be a set. Then $A$ is called cocountable if $A^c$ is countable.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Borel $\sigma$-algebra]
  Let $F \subseteq 2^X$ be a family of subsets of $X$.
  The $\sigma$-algebra generated by $F$ is defined as
  \[
    \sigma(F) = \cap \set{\mathcal A \subseteq 2^X \colon 
  \mathcal A \text{ is a $\sigma$-algebra} \stand F \subset \mathcal A}
  \]
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
  Notice that the intersection is indeed a $\sigma$-algerba.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  Let $\A$ be a $\sigma$-algebra and $F \subseteq \A$.
  Then $\sigma(F) \subseteq A$.
\end{remark}
\begin{corollary}
  Suppose $F_1 \subseteq \sigma(F_2)$ and $F_2 \subseteq \sigma(F_1)$.
  Then $\sigma(F_1) = \sigma(F_2)$.
\end{corollary}

Let 

% Add lecture 2 from Yarden etc.

We want to construct a measure space $(\R^n, \A, \mu)$ such that
\[
  \mu\del{\prod_{i=1}^{n} [a_i,b_i]} =
  \prod_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - b_i|.
\]

Recall that we saw earlier that
\[
  B(\R^n) =
  \otimes_{i=1}^{n} B(\R) =
  \sigma(\prod_{i=1}^{n} [a_i,b_i])
\]
Because we want the boxes to be contained in $\A$ we have that
$B(\R^n) \subseteq \A$.
To define the measure for other sets we can use an outer measure
\[
  \mu^*(E) := \int \set{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(R_i) \mid E \subset 
  \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} R_i}.
\]
Is $\mu^*(R) = \mu(R)$? Yes.
Did we get a measure? No, we got an outer measure.
\begin{remark}
  Defining $\mu^*$ only on ``good'' sets gives us Lebesgue measure.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Outer measure]
  Let $X \neq \emptyset$. Then $\mu^* \colon 2^X \to [0,\infty]$ is
  called an outer measure if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] $\mu^*(\emptyset) = 0$;
    \item[(2)] $\mu^*$ is monotone (if $A \subset B$ then $\mu(A) < \mu(B)$);
    \item[(3)] $\mu$ is subadditive ().
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $\mathcal E \subseteq 2^X$ be a family of subsets of $X$ and
  $\varphi \colon \mathcal E \to [0,\infty]$ such that
  $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal E$ and $\varphi(\emptyset) = 0$.
  For all $A \subseteq X$ we define
  \[
    \mu^*(A) = \inf\set{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \varphi(E_i) \colon 
    E_i \in \mathcal E \stand A \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i}
  \]
  then $\mu^*$ is an outer measure.
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
  It is not promised that $\mu*(E) = \varphi(E)$ for $E \in \mathcal E$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)] We can cover by $E_i = \emptyset$.
  \item[(2)] Let $A \subseteq B$.
    We can use the cover of $B$ for $A$ since 
    $A \subseteq B \subseteq \cup E_i$ which implies $\mu^*(A) \le \mu^*(B)$.
  \item[(3)]
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Every outer measure can be constructed the way we constructed them.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[$\mu^*$-measurable set]
  A set $A \subseteq X$ is called $\mu^*$-measurable if
  \[
    \forall E \subseteq X \colon
    \mu^*(E) = \mu^*(E \cap A) + \mu^*(E \cap A^c).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Caratheodory's outer measure theorem]
  Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on $X$. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] $\mathcal F_{\mu^*} := \set{\mu^*\text{-measurable sets}}$ is a 
      $\sigma$-algebra.
    \item[(2)] $(X, \mathcal F_{\mu^*}, \mu^*\vert_{\mathcal F_{\mu^*}})$
      is a complete measure space.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
