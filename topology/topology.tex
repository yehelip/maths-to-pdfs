\section{Introduction}

Before getting into the main part of the course, we can first look
at topology from the viewpoint it was considered hundreds of years ago.

\begin{definition}[Geodesic triangle]
  A geodesic triangle is the area enscribed inside $3$ points
  on a sphere.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Girard's theorem]
  \label{thm:girard}
  Let $T$ be a geodesic triangle.
  Denote its angles $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$.
  Then we have $\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 > 180^{\circ}$ and
  \[
    \mathrm{Area}(T) = \theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 - \pi.
  \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Geometric.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Euler's theorem]
  Let $P$ be a convex polyhydron.
  Denote $E$ the number of edges in $P$, $V$ the number of vertices in $P$,
  and $F$ the number of faces of $P$.
  Then
  \[
    V - E + F = 2.
  \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Begin by ensphering the polyhydron in the unit sphere.
  Put a flashlight inside the polyhydron such that the faces of $P$
  cast shadows of geodesic polygons on the sphere.
  
  Now we trianglize all the geodesic polygons.
  We have
  \[
    \boxed{2 E = 3 F}
  \]
  Denote the trianlges $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_F$.
  From \Cref{thm:girard} we have that
  \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{F} \frac{\theta_1^i + \theta_2^i + \theta_3^i}{V} - \pi =
    4 \pi.
  \]
  From this we get
  \[
    2 \pi V - \pi F = 4 \pi \implies
    \boxed{2 V - F = 4}
  \]
  From these equations we can deduce the desired relation
  \[
    \boxed{V - E + F = 2}
  \]
  which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  box with a hold in the middle.
\end{example}

\section{Quotient spaces and complexes}

\subsection{Quotient spaces}

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and let $\sim$ be an equivalence
relation on $X$.
Denote:
\[
  [x] := \set{y \in X \mid y \sim x}.
\]
Also define the function
\[
  \fullfunction{\pi}{X}{\bigslant{X}{\sim}}{x}{[x]}.
\]

\begin{definition}[Quotient topology]
  We define on $\bigslant{X}{\sim}$ the quotient topology $\tau_{\sim}$
  by $U \in \tau_{\sim}$ if and only if $\pi^{-1}(U) \in \tau$.
\end{definition}

In other words, the quotient topolgoy is the topology generated by $\pi$.

\begin{proposition}[Universal property of quotient spaces]
  Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces, let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation
  on $X$, and $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function such that for every 
  $x \sim x' \in X$ we have $f(x) = f(x')$.
  Then there exists $f' \colon \bigslant{X}{\sim} \to Y$ such that
  $f' \circ \pi = f$ where $\pi$ is the quotient projection.
  Moreover, $f'$ is continuous if and only if $f$ is continuous.
  In a diagram it looks like this:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[rd, "f"] \arrow[d, "\pi"']         &   \\
    \bigslant{X}{\sim} \arrow[r, "f'"', dashed] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The first part of the proof is clear, so we will focus on the equivalence
  of continuity between $f$ and $f'$.
  It is clear that $\pi$ is continuous so when $f'$ is continuous
  we also have that $f = f' \circ \pi$ is continuous.

  Next suppose $f$ is continuous.
  To be added
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Let $X = [0,1]$ with the topology induced by the standard topology on $\R$.
  Let $\sim$ be the equivalence relation generated by $0 \sim 1$.
  Thus,
  \[
    \bigslant{X}{\sim} \cong S^1 = \set{z \in \C^2 \colon |z| = 1}.
  \]
  We define $f \colon X \to S^1$ by $f(t) = e^{2 \pi i t}$.
  Since $f$ is continuous and $f(0) = f(1)$, from the universal property
  of quotient spaces there exists a continuous function 
  $f' \colon \bigslant{X}{\sim} \to S^1$ defined by $f'([x]) = f(x)$.
  It is clear that $f$ is one to one and onto.
  To show that it is a homeomorphism we can use the following lemma
  \begin{lemma}
    Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces.
    Suppose that $X$ is compact, $Y$ is Hausdorff.
    Then every continuous function from $X$ to $Y$ is a closed transformation.
    In particular, if $f$ is one to one and onto, it is a homeomorphism.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $C$ be a closed set in $X$.
    Since $X$ is compact $C$ is compact.
    Since $f$ is continuous $f(C)$ is compact in the Hausdorff space $Y$
    and thus closed which completes the proof.
  \end{proof}
  \begin{remark}
    Recall that the last part of the lemma is true because an open bijection
    is a homeomorphism.
  \end{remark}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  We will show that
  \[
    X = \bigslant{\C \setminus \set{0}}{x \sim \lambda x} \quad
    \forall 0 \meq \lambda \in \R
  \]
  is homeomorphic to the unit sphere $S^1$.
  First define the function
  \[
    \fullfunction{f}{\C \setminus \set{0}}{S^1}{z}{\del{\frac{z}{|z|}}^2}
  \]
  The function $f$ is continuous and satisfies $f(x) = f(\lambda x)$ for all
  $0 \neq \lambda \in \R$.
  Thus, from the universal property of quotient spaces there exists
  a continuous function $f' \colon X \to S^1$.
  It is clear that $f$ is one to one and onto.
  We have that $X = \pi(S^1)$ because every element in $C \setminus \set{0}$
  is equivalent to some element in $S^1$, and since $\pi$ is continuous
  and $S^1$ is compact, it follows that $X$ is also compact.
  It is clear that $S^1$ is Hausdorff, and thus from the previous lemma
  we have that $f'$ is a homeomorphism between $X$ and $S^1$.
\end{example}

From now on we denote
\begin{align*}
  &D^n := \set{x \in \R^n \colon \norm{x} \le 1}; \\
  &S^n := \partial D^{n+1} = \set{x \in \R^{n+1} \colon \norm{x} = 1}; \\
  &T^n := (S^1)^n.
\end{align*}
We can see that
\[
  D^0 = \set{0} \stand \partial D^0 = \emptyset \stand S^0 = \set{-1, 1}.
\]

\begin{example}
  We have that $\bigslant{D^n}{S^{n-1}} \cong S^n$.
  The equivalence relation here is $x \sim y$ if and only if $x,y \in S^{n-1}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  We have that $\bigslant{\R}{\Z} \cong S^1$ where $x \sim x + k$ for all
  $x \in \R$, $k \in \Z$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  For all $x \in \R^n \setminus \set{0}$ and $\lambda \in (0,\infty)$ we
  have:
  \[
    S^n \cong \bigslant{\R^n \setminus \set{0}}{x \sim \lambda x}.
  \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Pastings}

The following lemma will allow us to discuss more pastings of spaces.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $X$ be a topological space, $\sim$ an equivalence relation on $X$,
  let $\pi$ the quotient projection, and $f$ a continuous function such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] $f$ is constant on the fibers of $\pi$.
    \item[(2)] $f'$ is one to one and onto.
    \item[(3)] $f$ is closed, open, or ($\bigslant{X}{\sim}$ is compact and
      $Y$ is Hausdorff).
  \end{enumerate}
  Then $f'$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
  Let $X = [0,1] \cup [2,3]$ and $\sim := 1 \sim 2$.
  Then $\bigslant{X}{\sim} = [0,2]$.
  We can see this by defining the function $f \colon X \to [0,2]$ as such
  \[
    x \mapsto
    \begin{cases}
      x, & 0 \le x \le 1 \\
      x - 1, & 2 \le x \le 3
    \end{cases}.
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Define
  \begin{align*}
    \R_n^+ &= \set{(x_1,\dots,x_n) \mid x_i \geq 0 } \\
    \R_n^- &= \set{(x_1,\dots,x_n) \mid x_i \le 0 }
  \end{align*}
  Define $X = \R_n^+ \cup \R_n^+$ (note that we treat this as a dijoint union).
  We define the equivalence relation 
  $(x_1^+,\dots,x_{n-1}^+, 0) \sim (x_1^-,\dots,x_{n-1}^-,0)$
  and then we have $\R^n \cong \bigslant{X}{\sim}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $X = I \times I$ where $I = [0,1]$.
  We define the equivalence relation as such $(s,0) \sim (s,1)$ for all
  $0 \le s \le 1$.
  Then $\bigslant{X}{\sim}$ is homeomorphic to a cylinder.
  We can see this by defining the function
  \[
    \fullfunction{f}{I \times I}{S \times I}
    {(s,t)}{(\cos 2 \pi t, \sin 2 \pi t, s)}
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $X = I \times I$.
  Define the equivalence relation $(s, 0) \sim (1 - s, 1)$.
  The space $\bigslant{X}{\sim}$ is homeomorphic to a Mobius strip.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $X = I \times I$.
  Define the equivalence relation $(s, 0) \sim (s, 1)$ and 
  $(0, t) \sim (1, t)$.
  The space $\bigslant{X}{\sim}$ is homeomorphic to a torus (specifically
  $T^2$).
\end{example}

\subsection{CW complexes}

\subsubsection{Disjoint union}

\begin{definition}[Disjoint union topology]
  Let $\set{X_{\alpha}}_{\alpha}$ be a collection of topological spaces.
  We define the dijoint union topology in the following manner.
  We say that $U \subset \coprod_{\alpha} X_{\alpha}$ is open if and only
  if $U \cap X_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  A disjoint union of points is an open set if every $X_{\alpha}$ is endowed
  with the discrete topology.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  We have that $D^1 \coprod D^1 \cong [0,1] \cup [2,3]$ with the standard
  topology.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}[Universal property of disjoint union]
  Let $\set{X_{\alpha}}_{\alpha}, Y$ be topological spaces,
  let $f_{\alpha} \colon X_{\alpha} \to Y$ be continuous functions.
  Then exists a unique continuous function 
  $f \colon \coprod_{\alpha} X_{\alpha} \to Y$ such that
  $f_{\alpha} = f \circ i_{\alpha}$ where $i_{\alpha} \colon X_{\alpha} \to
  \coprod_{\alpha} X_{\alpha}$ is the injection map.
  In a diagram, it looks like this:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \coprod_{\alpha} X_{\alpha} \arrow[rd, "\exists !f", dashed] &   \\
      X_{\alpha} \arrow[u, "i_{\alpha}"] \arrow[r, "f_i"']         & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{proposition}

\subsubsection{CW complexes}

\begin{definition}[CW complex]
  A CW complex is a topological space $X$ with subspaces
  \[
    \emptyset= X^{-1} \subseteq X^{0} \subseteq X^{1} \subseteq \cdots
    \subseteq X = \bigcup_{n} X^{n}
  \]
  such that the spaces $X^n$ are constructed inductively in the following
  way. Define
  \[
    X^{-1} := \emptyset.
  \]
  For $n \geq 1$ assume that $X^{n-1}$ is defined.
  Let $\set{D^n_{\alpha}}_{\alpha}$ be a collection of $n$-dimensional discs,
  let $\set{f_{\alpha} \colon \partial D^n_{\alpha} \to X^{n-1}}_{\alpha}$
  be a collection of continuous functions. Define:
  \[
    X^{n} := 
    \bigslant{
    \del{X^{n-1} \rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{\Pi} \coprod_{\alpha} D^n_{\alpha}}}
    {\sim}
  \]
  where $\sim$ is generated by $x \sim f_{\alpha}(x)$ for all $\alpha$ and
  for all $x \in \partial D^n$.
  We endow the space $X = \cup_{n} X^n$ with the topology such that 
  $U \subset X$ open if and only if $U \cap X^n$ is open for every $n$.
  The space $X$ is called a CW complex. The $X^n$ subspace is called the
  $n$-skeleton of the complex.
  The pairs $(D^n_{\alpha}, f_{\alpha})$ are called the $n$-cells of
  the complex.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  In most examples, the construction process of the complex is finite.
  In this case there exists $n$ such that $X^n = X$.
  We call $n$ the dimension of the complex.
  In particular, the $n$-skeleton $X^n$ is a CW complex of dimension $n$
  (at most).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  A $0$-dimensional complex $X$ is a discrete set.
  The $0$-cells are called the vertices of $X$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  A $1$-dimensional complex $X$ is a topological graph.
  The $1$-cells are called the edges of $X$.
  Each edge connects to vertices in its extremes.
  \begin{remark}
    Notice that a topological graph is not a simple graph --- each edge
    can connect a vertice to itself, and more than a single edge can
    connect the same vertices.
  \end{remark}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  We describe a CW complex for the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$.
  Let $X^{0} = \set{*}$ be with a single vertice, and a single $n$-cell
  $D^n_{\alpha}$.
  Since there are no cells of dimensions $0 < i < n$ we get $X^{n-1} = \set{*}$.
  The pasting map of the cell $D^n_{\alpha}$ is the constant map
  $F_{\alpha} \colon \partial D^n_{\alpha} \to X^{n-1} = \set{*}$,
  and indeed we have $S^n = X^n = \bigslant{\set{*} \coprod D^n_{\alpha}}{\sim}$
  where $x \sim *$ for all $x \in \partial D^n_{\alpha}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Using the construction from the previous example, we can construct a CW
  complex for the torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ in the following way.
  Let $v$ be a vertice, $a$, $b$ be edges, and $s$ be $2$-cell.
  We connect the $2$-cell by
  TO BE CONTINUED
\end{example}

In general, we only require the pasting maps of CW complexes to be continuous,
but in practice we will only consider very nice pasting maps.
For example pasting faces of polygons.

\begin{definition}[Polygonal complex]
  A polygonal complex is a CW complex of dimension $2$ such that the pasting
  maps of the $2$-cells identify the $2$-cell as a (regular) polygon,
  and paste each of its edges to an edge in $X^1$.
\end{definition}
