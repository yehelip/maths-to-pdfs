\section{Introduction}
\begin{definition}[Riemann surface]
    A Riemann surface is a $1$-dimensional complex manifold.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Riemann surface]
    A Riemann surface is a topological space $X$ together with
    open subsets $\set{U_k}_{k \in I}$ of $X$ with
    $\cup_{k \in I} U_k = X$ together with maps $f_i \colon U_i \to \C$
    such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(1)] Each $f_i$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.
        \item[(2)] If $U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset$ then 
            $f_i \circ f_j^{-1} \colon 
            f_j(U_i \cap U_j) \to f_i(U_i \cap U_j)$ are \emph{biholomorphic}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    A function $f \colon \C \to \C$ is holomorphic at $p$ if 
    $f'(p) = \lim_{z \to p} \frac{f(z) - f(p)}{z - p}$ exists.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Biholomorphism]
    A function $f \colon \C \to \C$ is called biholomorphic if it has an inverse
    and both $f$ and $f'$ are holomorphic.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Atlas]
    The $\set{(U_i, f_i)}_{i \in I}$ are called an atlas of the Riemann surface.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chart]
    Each individual $(U_i, f_i)$ is called a chart of the Riemann surface.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let $U \subset \C$.
    Then $U$ can take an atlas with one chart which is the identity map.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Riemann sphere]
    Let $X = \set{(z,t) \in \C \times \R \colon |z|^2 + t^2 = \R}$.
    We identify $\C$ with the $xy$ plane.
    Denote $N$ and $S$ the north and south poles of the sphere accordingly.
    We define $\pi_N \colon \C \to S$ such that $\pi_N$ sends each point
    $(z,t)$ on the sphere to its stereographic projection 
    from $N$ onto the plane (point $\xi$) as can be seen in the figure
    below:
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{RiemannSphere.png}
    \end{center}
    We can similarly define $\pi_S$ and verify that the images of the
    projections are $X \setminus \set{N}$ and $X \setminus \set{S}$
    accordingly.
    
    Now $X$ is a Riemann surface with an atlas consisting of 
    $\pi_S \colon X \setminus \set{S} \to \C$ and
    $\pi_N \colon X \setminus \set{N} \to \C$.
    We denote the Riemann sphere as $\hat{\C}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Biholomorphism of Riemann surfaces]
    Let $(X, (U_i, f_i))$, $(Y, (W_i,g_i))$ be two Riemann surfaces.
    A biholomorphism between them is a homeomorphism
    $X \xrightarrow{\phi} Y$ such that $g_i \circ \phi \circ f_i^{-1}$ 
    are biholomorphisms on their domains of definition.
\end{definition}

A main problem in Riemann surfaces was classifying certain types of 
Riemann surfaces up to biholomorphisms.

\begin{theorem}\tt{Riemann mapping theorem}
    Any two proper open simply connected subsets of $\C$ are biholomorphic.
\end{theorem}

A generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem is the uniformization theorem
proved by Kobe in 1907.

\begin{theorem}\tt{Uniformization theorem}
    Any simply connected Riemann surface is biholomorphic to one of the
    following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(1)] $\C$
        \item[(2)] $\hat{\C}$
        \item[(3)] $\H = \set{z \in \C \colon \mathrm{Im}(z) > 0}$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We will give a proof for this theorem in the end of the class.

A natural question that arises is what about non simply connected Riemann
surfaces?

\begin{theorem}\tt{Uniformization theorem, part II}
    Any connected Riemann surface is biholomorphic either to $\hat{\C}$
    or to a quotient of $\C$ or $\H$ by a properly discontinuous
    torsion-free subgroup of biholomorphisms.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    Biholomorphisms of $U = \C$ or $\H$ (or any subset of $\C$)
    forms a group under composition.
    We denote that group by $\Bih(U)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Properly discontinuous group]
    A countable subgroup of $\Bih(U)$ is said to be properly discontinuous
    if for all compact $K \subseteq U$, the set 
    $\set{g \in G \colon gK \cap K \neq \emptyset}$ is finite.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Torsion-free group]
    $G \subseteq \Bih(U)$ is torsion-free if $gp = p$ for some $p \in U$
    implies $g$ is the identity.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Notice that multiplication in $gp$ is the group action of $g$ on the 
  set $U$. That us $gp = g(p)$.
\end{remark}

We can know define the quotient space $\bigslant{U}{G}$ where
$p \sim q$ if there exists $g \in G$ such that $gp = q$.

Introduce a topology on $\bigslant{U}{G}$ which is the coarsest topology
such that the canonical projections $U \to \bigslant{U}{G}$ are continuous.

Under the assumptions that $G$ is properly discontinuous and torsion-free,
$\bigslant{U}{G}$ is a Riemann surface with the following charts.
By assumptions on $G$, we can find for any $p \in U$ a neighbourhood $W$ of
$p \in U$ such that $\pi \colon U \to \bigslant{U}{G}$ is a homeomorphism
onto its image when restricted to $W$.

So, restrictions of $\pi$ to these neighbourhoods $W$ give an atlas.
